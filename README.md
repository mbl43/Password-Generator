# Simple Password Generator Application using React ,Tailwind, Vite

This code demonstrates the use of several React hooks to manage state and side effects within a functional component. Here's a breakdown of the hooks used and their purposes:

- **useState**: This hook is used to declare state variables within the functional component. It's used to manage the following state variables:
 - `length`: Represents the length of the generated password.
 - `number`: A boolean indicating whether numbers should be included in the password.
 - `charallow`: A boolean indicating whether special characters should be included in the password.
 - `password`: Stores the generated password.

- **useRef**: This hook is used to create a reference (passwordInputRef) to the password input field. This reference is used to programmatically select and copy the generated password to the clipboard.

- **useCallback**: This hook is used to memoize the `passwordgen` and `passwordcopy` functions. This means that these functions are only re-created when their dependencies change, which can help optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders or function re-creations.

- **passwordgen**: Generates a new password based on the current state of `length`, `number`, and `charallow`. It concatenates characters from a predefined string of letters, numbers, and special characters to create the password.

- **passwordcopy**: Copies the generated password to the clipboard and shows an alert to the user.

- **useEffect**: This hook is used to perform side effects in the component. In this case, it's used to call the `passwordgen` function whenever the `length`, `number`, or `charallow` state variables change. This ensures that the password is regenerated whenever the user changes the settings.

The application allows users to generate a password of a specified length, with options to include numbers and special characters. The generated password is displayed in a read-only input field, and users can copy the password to their clipboard by clicking a button.
