# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This code is for a simple password generator application built using React. It demonstrates the use of several React hooks to manage state and side effects within a functional component. Here's a breakdown of the hooks used and their purposes:

useState: This hook is used to declare state variables within the functional component. It's used to manage the following state variables:
length: Represents the length of the generated password.
number: A boolean indicating whether numbers should be included in the password.
charallow: A boolean indicating whether special characters should be included in the password.
password: Stores the generated password.
useRef: This hook is used to create a reference (passwordInputRef) to the password input field. This reference is used to programmatically select and copy the generated password to the clipboard.
useCallback: This hook is used to memoize the passwordgen and passwordcopy functions. This means that these functions are only re-created when their dependencies change, which can help optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders or function re-creations.
passwordgen: Generates a new password based on the current state of length, number, and charallow. It concatenates characters from a predefined string of letters, numbers, and special characters to create the password.
passwordcopy: Copies the generated password to the clipboard and shows an alert to the user.
useEffect: This hook is used to perform side effects in the component. In this case, it's used to call the passwordgen function whenever the length, number, or charallow state variables change. This ensures that the password is regenerated whenever the user changes the settings.
The application allows users to generate a password of a specified length, with options to include numbers and special characters. The generated password is displayed in a read-only input field, and users can copy the password to their clipboard by clicking a button
